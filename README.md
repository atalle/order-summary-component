## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge helped me hone my layout skills! I'm also encouraged because I was able to solve thiis a bit faster (completed in one hour!) The trickest part for me was implementing the "plan details section" â€“ I tried several solutions in search of the simplest and most DRY code (restuctured the HTML, tried CSS grid and position properties) before solving for this with Flexbox.

### Continued development

I'm sure I will be back to refactor this code after a little more experience! In particular, I would love feedback on how to stretch the background pattern full-width. Those background patterns seem to get the best of me!
